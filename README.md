# ultimatetictactoe
Python pygame program to play ultimate tic tac toe. A 3x3x3 game of tictactoe where the same rules apply.
I used the help of PyGame for a win calculator file that helped me determine if the player had won or not. 
The rest of the code uses PyGameâ€™s software to create a layout and useability functions.
